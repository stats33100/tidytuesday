# History of the wettest month in UK -----------------------------------------------------------------

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Precipitation

# https://www.trevorharley.com/1903.html
# October 1903 has been the wettest month of all in the England and Wales rainfall series since records began in 1766: 
# an average of 218 mm of rain fell (268% of the long-term average). 450 mm fell in the Lake District. 
# By the end of the month it is estimated that 25,000 acres of farmland were under water, particularly the Ouses, Severn, Trent, and Thames.
# Tornadoes hit Wareham and Banbury on the 25th.
# Bridges were weakened and collapsed: at Risca (Monmouthshir) four arches of a 40 foot high viaduct crossing the Ebbw River collapsed. 
# In the north the harvest was severely affected. 

# https://community.netweather.tv/topic/100492-1903-the-worst-year-on-record/
# It's described as a very dull month practically everywhere with a high frequency of thunderstorms and most places saw rain fall 28-31 days of the month.
